### Instructins
We hope that you understand how important  it is to complete Lab Task in the correct spirit. 

These tasks are being conducted for you to get a feedback on your level of preparation. 

So at 5:30 pm sharp, you will start the lab task and by 7:30 pm you have to upload your solution in your *GIT Account *

Any attempt to copy  is like fooling yourself. 

PS: Helping your friend to solve a test will cause more harm than help
